# 100 Days Of Code - Log

<!--### Day 0: February 30, 2016 (Example 2)
##### (delete me or comment me out)

**Today's Progress**: Fixed CSS, worked on canvas functionality for the app.

**Thoughts**: I really struggled with CSS, but, overall, I feel like I am slowly getting better at it. Canvas is still new for me, but I managed to figure out some basic functionality.

**Link(s) to work**: [Calculator App](http://www.example.com)-->


### Day 1: February 6th, 2017

**Today's Progress**: I've finished 6 Javascript exercises on FreeCodeCamp. I'm 74% done with the Javascript module.

**Thoughts** I'm feeling pretty good! I struggled a few times with two challenges today but I worked through them and it felt great!

### Day 2: February 7th, 2017

**Today's Progress**: I struggled for one hour and didn't complete the "Counting Cards" challenege in the Javascript module.

**Thoughts**: It was frustrating. At first, I didn't understand what desired outcome was but after doing some research and reading about what other people were trying to do, I realized there were multiple ways to solve it. I didn't complete it because I ran out of time but I think I'll be able to figure out the solution tomorrow.
