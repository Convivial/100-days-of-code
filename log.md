# 100 Days Of Code - Log

<!--### Day 0: February 30, 2016 (Example 2)
##### (delete me or comment me out)

**Today's Progress**: Fixed CSS, worked on canvas functionality for the app.

**Thoughts**: I really struggled with CSS, but, overall, I feel like I am slowly getting better at it. Canvas is still new for me, but I managed to figure out some basic functionality.

### Day 1: February 6th, 2017

**Today's Progress**: I've finished 6 Javascript exercises on FreeCodeCamp. I'm 74% done with the Javascript module.

**Thoughts** I'm feeling pretty good! I struggled a few times with two challenges today but I worked through them and it felt great!


### Day 2: February 7th, 2017

**Today's Progress**: I struggled for one hour and didn't complete the "Counting Cards" challenege in the Javascript module. But then, I took a break, thought about it, wrote out some ideas and tested them and found the solution!

**Thoughts**: It was frustrating. At first, I didn't understand what desired outcome was but after doing some research and reading about what other people were trying to do, I realized there were multiple ways to solve it. I didn't complete it because I ran out of time but later found some time to try a few other ideas and solved it! As I delve deeper into the tutorials on FCC, I realize I'm going to need to be creative with the ways I solve the upcoming exercises. 


### Day 3: February 8th, 2017

**Today's Progress**: I coded for 1 hour. I completed 8 Javascript exercises on FreeCodeCamp. One of the challenges was tough because I had to modify a line of code that was above the line that says "Only change code below the line." So I submitted an issue on the FCC repository- it was my first time doing so. I considered teaching myself how to submit pull requests but decided that should be left for another day with more time. 

**Thoughts**: I'm still enjoying coding! Instead of getting frustrated when I don't complete a challenge first try, I stop, take a breath, and try to figure out what might be wrong. It's a habit I want to build early on, especially if I decide to pursue coding as a career. Since I didn't finish the last challenge I was on, I feel anxious to work on it again and solve it. If I have more time tonight, I'll work on it. Otherwise, I'll solve it tomorrow


### Day 4: February 9th, 2017 

**Today's Progress**: Coded for 1 hour at a Starbucks in Dana Point. I finished 8 Javascript exercises on FCC. Still having some trouble understanding arrays. 

**Thoughts**: Feeling good! I cranked through those 8 problems and got stuck towards the end of the hour on the 9th challenge "Nested for Loops." I'll figure it out tomorrow.
