# 100 Days Of Code - Log

<!--### Day 0: February 30, 2016 (Example 2)
##### (delete me or comment me out)

**Today's Progress**: Fixed CSS, worked on canvas functionality for the app.

**Thoughts**: I really struggled with CSS, but, overall, I feel like I am slowly getting better at it. Canvas is still new for me, but I managed to figure out some basic functionality.

**Thoughts**: -->


### Day 1: February 6th, 2017

**Today's Progress**: I've finished 6 Javascript exercises on FreeCodeCamp. I'm 74% done with the Javascript module.

**Thoughts** I'm feeling pretty good! I struggled a few times with two challenges today but I worked through them and it felt great!


### Day 2: February 7th, 2017

**Today's Progress**: I struggled for one hour and didn't complete the "Counting Cards" challenege in the Javascript module. But then, I took a break, thought about it, wrote out some ideas and tested them and found the solution!

**Thoughts**: It was frustrating. At first, I didn't understand what desired outcome was but after doing some research and reading about what other people were trying to do, I realized there were multiple ways to solve it. I didn't complete it because I ran out of time but later found some time to try a few other ideas and solved it! As I delve deeper into the tutorials on FCC, I realize I'm going to need to be creative with the ways I solve the upcoming exercises. 


### Day 3: February 8th, 2017

**Today's Progress**: I coded for 1 hour. I completed 8 Javascript exercises on FreeCodeCamp. One of the challenges was tough because I had to modify a line of code that was above the line that says "Only change code below the line." So I submitted an issue on the FCC repository- it was my first time doing so. I considered teaching myself how to submit pull requests but decided that should be left for another day with more time. 

**Thoughts**: I'm still enjoying coding! Instead of getting frustrated when I don't complete a challenge first try, I stop, take a breath, and try to figure out what might be wrong. It's a habit I want to build early on, especially if I decide to pursue coding as a career. Since I didn't finish the last challenge I was on, I feel anxious to work on it again and solve it. If I have more time tonight, I'll work on it. Otherwise, I'll solve it tomorrow


### Day 4: February 9th, 2017 

**Today's Progress**: Coded for 1 hour at a Starbucks in Dana Point. I finished 8 Javascript exercises on FCC. Still having some trouble understanding arrays. 

**Thoughts**: Feeling good! I cranked through those 8 problems and got stuck towards the end of the hour on the 9th challenge "Nested for Loops." I'll figure it out tomorrow. 

### Day 5: February 10th, 2017

**Today's Progress**: Coded for 35 minutes. Wish I had more time. I started "Profile Lookup" challenge but didn't have time to try it more than once. Hopefully I can finish the last 8 Javascript challenges tomorrow or before Monday. 

**Thoughts**: Life is good. Code is good. I am really enjoying this because it brings me back to the days in  Pre-Calc and Calculus when I would have to try a bunch of different ways to get the solution. It's a challenge and I'm ready for it. Bring it on.

### Day 6: February 11th, 2017

**Today's Progress**: I coded for 2 hours at the library. I finally finished the Javascript module and the Object Oriented and Functional Programming module. Now onto the Basic Algorithm Scripting module.

**Thoughts**: I'm a little nervous for the next module but as long as I believe in myself and put in the work, I know I'll be able to figure them out.

### Day 7: February 12th, 2017

**Today's Progress**: Coded for 30 minutes and finished my first algorithm problem! It was simpler than I thought. I learned that I can run/execute methods on the return line in JS. 

**Thoughts**: Feeling good! I'm excited for more algorithm problems because I think they'll be fun. As a kid, I remember playing Madden and other sports games, thinking about how the video game figured out where to put the yellow line for the first down and what the algorithm looked like in my head. 

### Day 8: February 13th, 2017

**Today's Progress**: Coded for 30 minutes trying to solve Factorals in the second basic algorithm module. I know the formula but haven't quite figured out how to tell in it words that Javascript understands.

**Thoughts**: Felt frustrated today but let it pass on, like a cloud. Tomorrow, I'll work and figure it out (I hope). 

### Day 9: February 14th, 2017

**Today's Progress**: Coded for 45 minutes and figured out the second algorithm on FCC!

**Thoughts**: Feeling good but read this https://goo.gl/5OGPXi and now second guessing the path I'm on. Going to spend a few days thinking about what's the best track and what my goals should be.

### Day 10: February 15th, 2017

**Today's Progress**: Coded for 30 minutes. Didn't accomplish much. Watched a few videos on Javascript. Trying to figure out how to start writing my code in my own text editor.

**Thoughts**: Feeling some "resistance" but no one said it was going to be easy! Still trotting along with a big smile.

### Day 11: February 16th, 2017

**Today's Progress**: Coded for 45 minutes. Feeling fantastic! Had an okay day but coding sure has me in high spirits! Read up to page 31 in YDKJS, Up and Going. Practiced JS in the Chrome dev tools console- super cool!

**Thoughts**: I can totally do this! I felt overwhelmed the other day but I'm feeling good now! On track.   

### Day 12: February 17th, 2017

**Today's Progress**: Coded for 45 minutes. Feeling good still. Finished Chp1 of YDKJS Up and Going. Practiced writing some JS in the console.

**Thoughts**: The process is slow but if I rush, I won't learn things as well and it will hurt me in the future. #SlowandSteady

### Day 13: February 18th, 2017

**Today's Progress**: Coded for 150 minutes. Feeling great! Finished book 1 in the YDKJS series and started reading the second. Also, began reading Medium article on Pure CSS images. Started working on it in Brackets as well. Had some trouble and didn't finish but will tomorrow.

**Thoughts**: Thinking that I will try to make JavaScript the first language I learn (and learn it well). I've heard that's one of the best things to do- learn your first language well and learn the fundamentals well so that's what I plan to do.

### Day 14: February 19th, 2017

**Today's Progress**: Coded for 30 minutes. Finished Pure CSS tutorial and created a Koala Bear. 

**Thoughts**: After a few more tutorials in CSS, I think I'll be able to make my own images.

### Day 15: February 20th, 2017

**Today's Progress**: Coded for 30 minutes. Finished Chapter 2 of YDKJS series on Lexical Scope. 

**Thoughts**: Learning a lot about JavaScript. Ready to write more code!

### Day 16: February 21st, 2017

**Today's Progress**: Coded for 45 minutes. Finished Chapter 3 and 4 of YDKJS on Scopes and Closures.

**Thoughts**: Definitely understanding JS a lot better now. Looking forward to writing some JS code in the near future.

### Day 17: February 22nd, 2017

**Today's Progress**: Coded for 45 minutes. Finished book 2 (Scopes and Closures) of YDKJS series.

### Day 18: February 23rd, 2017

### Day 19: February 24th, 2017

**Today's Progress**: Coded for 30 minutes. Finished chapter 3 of YDKSJS book 3 this and object. Also checked out a few courses for developing a website.

**Thoughts**: Thinking I'm going to take a break from all this JavaScript reading and do some actual coding.

### Day 20: February 25th, 2017

**Today's Progress**: Coded for 45 minutes. Successfully installed Ruby, Ruby Gems, and Homebrew using the command line. Started reading about Jekyll
